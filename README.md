# macroCalculator

This is a simple program to calculate macronutrients and caloric intake based on a user's fitness goals.

I'm running Linux and cmake for compilation.  The steps for compiling this program might be different for you based on your environment.

To run program on your local:

1) git clone the repo onto your local machine.
  
 git clone https://github.com/cityscapedview/macroCalculator.git

2) cd into the macroCalculator directory.

  cd macroCalculator

3) Create a build directory and cd into it.
  
  mkdir build
  cd build
  
4) Run Cmake: This configures the build process.
  
  cmake ..
  
5) Build the project: This compiles your code and creates the executable.

  make
  
6) Run the executable.

 ./MyProject
